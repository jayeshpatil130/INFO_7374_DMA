## Use Case 1 : Customer Attrition
### Machine Learning Models

•	Models like Logistic Regression, XgBoost and ensembling implemented to classify the whether the customer would remain active or inactive

•	Churn is indicated as boolean value True or False

•	Colab Links

    https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1yR-267MDawn-n3HErfkeaVNKoUZaSgcN

### ML as a service

Customer attrition predicted using AWS XGBoost algorithm on AWS Sagemaker which can be invoked by using REST APIs

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Use Case 2 : Customer Lifetime Value Prediction
### Machine Learning Models

•	Models like Linear Regression and Randomforest Regressor implemented to predict the customer lifetime value

•	Colab Links

### ML as a service

Customer Lifetime Value predicted using AWS XGBoost algorithm on AWS Sagemaker which can be invoked by using REST APIs

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Use Case 3 : Customer Segmentation

### Machine Learning Models

•	RFM Analysis implemented to identify the segments based on customer behavior by generating the rfm score of customers by calculating recency, frequency and monetary value 

•	Customer segments identified are listed below

    	Best Customer
    	Big Spenders
    	Loyal Customers
    	Almost Lost Customers
    	Lost and cheap customers
    	Average Customers

•	Models like KNN, Logistic Regression, RandomForest Classifier, SVM and Ensemble Modeling implemented to classify customers into different segments
 
 •	Colab links
